    "# Poem-O-Matic\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a description, in both code and prose, of how to generate original poetry on demand using a computer and the Python programming language. It's based upon work done in the London Python Code Dojo with Dan Pope and Hans Bolang. I've taken some of our original ideas and run with them, specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "_If you re-assemble unrelated lines from different poems into a new poetic structure, you get a pretty convincing __new__ poem._\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exercise in doing the __simplest possible thing__ with a program to _fool humans_ into thinking the computer can write poetry. There are two reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple solutions are easy to understand and think about.\n",
    "* Simple solutions work well in an educational context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be blunt: we're going to use software to automate a sneaky way to create poems. The basic process is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take a huge number of existing source poems (written by humans) and chop them up into their constituent lines. These thousands of lines will be our source material.\n",
    "* Work out how the source lines rhyme and group them together into \"buckets\" containing lines that rhyme with each other.\n",
    "* Further categorise the rhymes in each bucket by word ending. For example, sub-categorise the bucket that rhymes with \"uck\" into slots for \"look\", \"book\", \"suck\" etc.\n",
    "* Specify a rhyming scheme. For example \"aabba\" means lines one, two and five (the \"a\"s) rhyme with each other, as do lines three and four (the \"b\"s).\n",
    "* Use the rhyming scheme to randomly select a bucket for each letter (for example, one bucket for the \"a\"s and yet another bucket for the \"b\"s) and randomly select a line from different word endings for each line in the rhyming scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a practical example of this process in plain English:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following three poems I just made up:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Poem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a special poem,\n",
    "The words, they are a flowing.\n",
    "It almost seems quite pointless,\n",
    "Since this poem is meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, my keyboard is on fire,\n",
    "Causing consternation and ire.\n",
    "Since words are cheap and cheerful,\n",
    "It's going to be quite an earful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Words are relentless,\n",
    "They light up minds like fire.\n",
    "Causing us to express,\n",
    "Ideas that flow like quagmire.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The rhyming schemes for each poem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Poem 1: aabb\n",
    "* Poem 2: aabb\n",
    "* Poem 3: abab\n",
    "\n",
    "If we cut up the poems into their constituent lines we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a special poem,\n",
    "It almost seems quite pointless,\n",
    "They light up minds like fire.\n",
    "Since this poem is meaningless.\n",
    "Causing consternation and ire.\n",
    "It's going to be quite an earful.\n",
    "Oh, my keyboard is on fire,\n",
    "Words are relentless,\n",
    "Since words are cheap and cheerful,\n",
    "Causing us to express,\n",
    "The words, they are a flowing.\n",
    "Ideas that flow like quagmire.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we bucket them by rhymes we get the following four groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The words, they are a flowing.\n",
    "This is a special poem,\n",
    "\n",
    "It almost seems quite pointless,\n",
    "Words are relentless,\n",
    "Since this poem is meaningless.\n",
    "Causing us to express,\n",

    "\n",
    "It's going to be quite an earful.\n",
    "Since words are cheap and cheerful,\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further refine the buckets into sub-categories based on word endings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FLOWING:\n",
    "  The words, they are a flowing.\n",
    "POEM:\n",
    "  This is a special poem,\n",
    "\n",
    "POINTLESS:\n",
    "  It almost seems quite pointless,\n",
    "RELENTLESS:\n",
    "  Words are relentless,\n",
    "MEANINGLESS:\n",
    "  Since this poem is meaningless.\n",
    "EXPRESS:\n",
    "  Causing us to express,\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRE:\n",
    "  They light up minds like fire.\n",
    "  Oh, my keyboard is on fire,\n",
    "IRE:\n",
    "  Causing consternation and ire.\n",
    "QUAGMIRE:\n",
    "  Ideas that flow like quagmire.\n",
    "\n",
    "EARFUL:\n",
    "  It's going to be quite an earful.\n",
    "CHEERFUL:\n",
    "  Since words are cheap and cheerful,\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how all but one of the subcategories contain a single line. This is simply because our source poems are limited in number and length. In the programmed example below we'll be working with tens of thousands of lines of poetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a new poem we specify a rhyming scheme for the new poem, for example: aabba. This tells us we need three \"a\" lines that rhyme with each other and two \"b\" lines that rhyme with each other. In other words we need two buckets of rhyming lines - from one we'll select three lines, from the other two lines. Given the list above I'll randomly pick the second and third buckets. Given that I don't want to repeat word endings I'll make sure I randomly choose lines from each bucket from a different word-ending subcategory. In the end I get the following lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Oh, my keyboard is on fire,\n",
    "Causing consternation and ire.\n",
    "Ideas that flow like quagmire.\n",
    "\n",
    "It almost seems quite pointless,\n",
    "Since this poem is meaningless.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If I arrange the lines into the aabba rhyming scheme I end up with the finished poem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Oh, my keyboard is on fire,\n",
    "Causing consternation and ire.\n",
    "It almost seems quite pointless,\n",
    "Since this poem is meaningless.\n",
    "Ideas that flow like quagmire.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given such a simple technique, the result is both interesting, meaningful and (almost) poetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, the important \"poetic sounding\" langauge is created by real poets - we're just going to use a Python program to reassemble lines from these poems to make new poetry.\n",
